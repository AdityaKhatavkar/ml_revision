# Bias 
    Inability of Machine learning model to truely capture the relationships in training data.

    If model is having high bias : Model is not trianing well.
    If model is having low bias : Model is training well.


# Variance 
    Difference of fits on different datasets.
    variance is the variability in a model's predictions when using different parts of the training data. It's also known as the "too sensitive" problem.

    If variance is high : Model is not good.

    If variance is low : Model is good.


# Overfitting 
    I model is good at traing and bad at testing.
    Low bias and high variance.



# Underfitting
    If mode is not good during training as well as during testing.
    High bias and high variance.


For good model : Low bias and low variance.


We have to find the sween spot between underfiting model and overfitting model.


Ther are some methods to find the sweet spot viz.
      Regularization
      Bagging 
      Boosting
